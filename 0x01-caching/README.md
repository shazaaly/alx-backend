# Advanced Caching Systems Project

## Description
This project is a Python-based caching system implementing various strategies like FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and Basic caching. It's designed to showcase different data management techniques and their applications in optimizing software performance.

## Installation
To set up the project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3. Run the script: `python3 <script_name>.py`

## Usage
You can interact with the caching system through the command line. Here are some common commands:
- `put <key> <value>`: Adds an item to the cache.
- `get <key>`: Retrieves an item from the cache.
- `show`: Displays the current state of the cache.

## Caching Strategy Explanations
- **Basic Caching:** A simple caching system without any limit.
- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Discards the oldest cache entry first.
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** Discards the most recently added entry first.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Discards the least recently used entry first.
- **MRU (Most Recently Used):** Discards the most recently used entry first.

Each strategy is beneficial in different scenarios, depending on the specific needs of data access patterns.

# Caching System CLI Usage Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions on how to use the CLI for interacting with various caching systems. It includes BasicCache, FIFOCache, LIFOCache, LRUCache, and MRUCache, each implementing different caching strategies.

## How to Use the CLI

### Running the Script

- Run your script in the terminal. If your script is named `cache_cli.py`, execute:
  ```bash
  ./cache_cli.py
  ```
- Ensure the script is executable. If necessary, run:
  ```bash
  chmod +x cache_cli.py
  ```

### Selecting a Caching System

- Upon running the script, it will prompt you to select a caching system. For example:
  ```
  Select a caching system:
  1. BasicCache
  2. FIFOCache
  3. LIFOCache
  4. LRUCache
  5. MRUCache
  Enter your choice (number):
  ```
- Enter the number corresponding to the caching system you want to use.

### Using Commands

After selecting a caching system, you can use the following commands:
- `put <key> <value>`: To add an item to the cache.
- `get <key>`: To retrieve an item from the cache.
- `show`: To display the current state of the cache.
- `switch`: To switch to a different caching system.
- `exit`: To exit the CLI.

### Example Interaction

Here's an example of how you might interact with the CLI:
```yaml
Enter command: put myKey myValue
Enter command: get myKey
myValue
Enter command: show
Current cache:
myKey: myValue
Enter command: switch
```
Then you can choose another caching system and continue.

### Switching Cache Systems

- Use the `switch` command at any time to change the caching strategy. The CLI will again prompt
