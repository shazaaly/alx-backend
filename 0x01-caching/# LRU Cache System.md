 # LRU Cache System

This repository contains a Python script for implementing a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache system. The LRU cache system is a data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of key-value pairs, and follows the LRU principle, where the least recently used item is discarded to make room for new items when the cache reaches its capacity.

## Code Overview

The code is organized as follows:

- `base_caching.py`: This file defines the `BaseCaching` class, which provides the basic functionality for a caching system. It includes methods for adding (`put`) and retrieving (`get`) key-value pairs, as well as a `MAX_ITEMS` attribute that specifies the maximum number of items the cache can hold.

- `lru_cache.py`: This file defines the `LRUCache` class, which extends the `BaseCaching` class and implements the LRU cache system. It includes an `order` attribute, which is an OrderedDict that keeps track of the order in which items are added to the cache.

## Implementation Details

### `LRUCache` Class

The `LRUCache` class is defined as follows:

```python
class LRUCache(BaseCaching):
    """LIFO cache system"""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.order = OrderedDict()
```

- The `__init__` method initializes the `LRUCache` object by calling the `__init__` method of the `BaseCaching` class, which sets up the basic caching functionality. It also initializes the `order` attribute as an OrderedDict.

### `put` Method

The `put` method is used to add a key-value pair to the cache. It is defined as follows:

```python
def put(self, key, item):
    """ put key value pair into cache"""
    discarded = None
    if (key is None or item is None):
        return
    self.cache_data[key] = item
    self.order[key] = item
    self.order.move_to_end(key)
    if len(self.cache_data) > BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
        discarded, item =  self.order.popitem(last=False)
        print(f"DISCARD: {discarded}")
```

- The method first checks
